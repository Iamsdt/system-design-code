# Contributing to System Design Code

Thanks for your interest in contributing — contributions make this project better!

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch named `yourname/short-description`.
2. Make small, focused changes and include tests when applicable.
3. Run the test suite and linters locally.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # development server
npm run test # run tests
npm run lint # run linters
npm run format # apply formatting
```

4. Commit using clear messages and open a PR against `main`.
5. The maintainers will review and request changes if necessary.

## PR checklist

- [ ] All new and existing tests pass
- [ ] Linting and formatting applied
- [ ] PR description explains the why (motivation) and what (changes)
- [ ] If the change is user-visible, update the docs/README accordingly

## Code style

- Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configuration.
- Keep changes focused and small — large architectural changes should be discussed via an issue first.

## Reporting bugs or requesting features

- Open an issue with a clear title and steps to reproduce (for bugs) or a detailed description (for features).

Thanks again — we appreciate your help!
